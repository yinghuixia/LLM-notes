# LLM notes
 
#### Evaluating LLM Products
Unlike the other products, LLM evaluation is less robust. Accuracy, precision, recall do not have the same value and connection with a use case that they do in a classification-based task, where they can be assigned to a context.

Something like a confusion matrix, is only as relevant as a similary matrix it represents.
